# MarkovMasher
python3 script that generates buttonmashes using markov chains

usage is pretty self-explainatory, just launch `main.py` from a terminal & follow the instructions

this isnt really useable as a library, maybe with some light tinkering but that wasnt really the goal and this is purely for shits and giggles

dont forget to install the `markovify` pip package
